# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

Aan expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be as simple as a single constant value or as complex as a combination of variables, operators, and function calls.
Example : let x = 5 + 3;" is an expression that adds 5 and 3 to assign the value 8 to the variable x.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

 We use loops to automate repetitive tasks by repeating code as long as conditions are met or for a specific number of iterations.

## When does a for loop stop executing?

>  Answer : A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop header becomes false.

 > for (let i = 0; i <= 12; i = i + 1) { 

> console.log(i* 8);

> }
# How many times will a while loop execute?

A while loop executes repeatedly as long as the condition evaluates to true.

The number of times a while loop executes depends on the condition.
